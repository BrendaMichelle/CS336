# CS336
Code written for the CS336 course at Rutgers University. This contains the server used for the final project, which was to buil a website for a chain of hotels. The website should be able to take in input from the user and effectively insert into a database as well as be able to get information as requested by the user. The server was built using PHP. This is not the final version of the server.
